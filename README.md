# Introducing Js Utils v4!

I'm thrilled to present Js Utils v3, born out of real-world experiences across various web development projects. You know those basic tasks we tackle day in and day out? That's precisely what this npm package is all aboutâ€”making your web dev life easier.

While the examples provided here utilize HTML elements by their IDs, please note that the functionalities offered in this project can also be employed with querySelector and querySelectorAll. Additionally, it's essential to emphasize that this project allows for flexibility and adaptation, empowering users to refactor and customize its functionalities based on their specific use cases and needs.

Cheers to simpler web development with process with Js Utils!
