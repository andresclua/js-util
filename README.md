# Introducing Js Utils v4!

Hello there! Since 2021, this was my debut publishing an NPM package. 

My goal was learn & offer support to UI developers who are familiar with jQuery, motivating them to transition towards a more lightweight library. 

This package is inspired by practical insights gathered from numerous web development projects. It targets those everyday challenges we face in web development, aiming to simplify your experience in web development.

## What to expect from V3 to V4

 - Move from webpack  to vite
 - Swap from Class to Single Functions
 - Provide ES6 & UMD output

## Other packages that I work
 - [attachflow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/attachflow) - dynamically load JavaScript files and CSS stylesheets into a webpage using the loadScript and loadStyle utility functions.
 - [Debounce Throttle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@andresclua/debounce-throttle) - JavaScript utility library for rate-limiting function executions. It offers both debounce and throttle functions that are essential for optimizing performance for events that fire frequently, such as window resizing, scrolling, or keypresses in web applications.
